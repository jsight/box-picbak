To use:

1. Get the mavenized box4j api
https://github.com/jsight/box-java-sdk

2. Compile both with maven

3. Get an API Key:
http://www.box.com/developers/services/new_service_terms

4. Place the key in src/main/resources/config.properties

5. Run:
java -jar picbak-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /localdir /remotedir

This will walk through a login, and upload of the local folder to box.net. 

Remote files that exactly match local files (based upon a SHA1 hash) will not be changed.
